# Onward to AdvenTOUR!

Onward to AdvenTOUR (OTA) is an application that primarily serves as a hub for adventurers around the (fictional) world to view and review habitats in their travels. The user is able to create an account to add their own reviews or rare sightings to the app, but is not required to log in to view such. All basic viewing functionality of OTA is available to all visitors, with an account only required to alter or add to the app.

## Initialization

When OTA is loaded, the user is met with the home page, which displays all habitats that have currently been reviewed by other users with their averaged out danger levels and ratings alongside them, as well as various ways to seek out specific habitats based on criteria. Various navigation options guide the user to other aspects of the app.

## Features

* User may view a list of all habitats, contributors, and rare sightings on the app, as well as individual pages for each.
* When signed up and logged in, the user may add new habitats to the app, new rare sightings found at habitats, as well as new reviews for existing habitats.
* The user, when on their own page, is able to edit aspects of their profile as well as make changes or deletions to their contributions.
* When viewing the main pages of the app, the user is able to search, filter, and sort the results for more effective finding of specific items.
* Simple navigation options allow the user to easily jump from main pages, as well as visiting habitats or contributors from reviews to learn more about either.

## All Items

On the three main pages of OTA, the user is met with a list of all entries for that category. On the initial home page, the user is shown display cards of all habitats that have currently been added to OTA. These display cards let the user see an image of the habitat as well as its danger level and rating, as averaged by the culmination of its reviews. Similarly if the user visits the rare sightings page they will see all rare sightings on OTA, with their name and image at the forefront, as well as which habitats they were spotted at. The contributors page is comparatively less visually exciting, but still lists all users who have added content to OTA. On all three main pages, the user is able to view the page of any specific item.

## Signing In and Add New Item

In order to contribute to OTA, a user needs an account. On any given page, the user may sign up or log in to the app, which will then redirect them to the home page on success. Errors or invalid credentials will be met with error messages on the form to guide the user toward success. Similar error messages appear on all forms within the app to assist the user.

Once the user is signed into an account, they are given access to add additional content to the app. On the home page they are given access to adding new habitats. As the app serves primarily as a place to see reviews of habitats, in order to add a habitat to the app, it must be accompanied with a complete review as well. On any individual habitat's page, a logged in user can also add their own review independently, changing its averaged danger and rating in real time. Lastly, a logged in user may also add new rare sightings to the app. Rare sightings may only be added to habitats that already exist on OTA. As previously mentioned, on all forms for adding or editing content, errors or invalid fields will be met with on-screen messages in red to notify the user and guide them toward fixes.

## Profile Page

On the Contributors page, a user is able to view any contributor's profile. Here the user maye view a contributor's reviews and/or rare sightings, as well as their profile picture and favorite biome. If the user is visiting their own profile page, they are given additional options. When visiting one's own profile page, a user is able to make changes to the aforementioned profile picture and favorite biome. Additionally the user is able to edit or entirely delete their contributed reviews or rare sightings. This is useful in situations where a previously unknown sighting is identified or conversely, found out to be a hoax.

## Main Page Criteria

For each of the main pages on OTA, a user is able to refine their results through various means. All three main pages allow the user to search for a specific item by name via a search bar. Further, all three main pages have some sort of way to filter their items as well. On the main page, the user is able to filter habitats down by the region in which they are found. This is primarily meant for users to plan out trips to regions or to explore their own home region. On the rare sightings page the user may filter results by habitats, either to see if a particular habitat has had any rare sightings or to see if one habitat is more prone to rare sightings. And lastly on the contributors page, a user can filter results by the contributor's favorite biome. This filter is meant to ideally lead the user to finding a contributor with similar preferences as them and therefore be more likely to visit and review habitats the user would enjoy themselves.

Additionally, the home and contributors pages both have ways for the user to sort the results. Both by default will sort their list alphabetically. On the contributors page, the user may also sort by which contributor has submitted the most reviews, or by who has had the most rare sightings. The home page meanwhile also allows the habitats to be sorted by which has had the most reviews submitted for it. Beyond that, the habitats may be sorted by the highest average rating, as well as by its averaged danger level, starting from the least dangerous. These options allow the user to get an idea for which habitats are considered favorites or which are best for a newer adventurer to visit.

## Menu Navigation

Navigation on OTA is kept minimum and simple. The Navigation Bar is present on all pages of the site, including the error page should a user somehow find themselves there. This NavBar allows the user to quickly get to any of the three main pages of OTA. On all non-error pages, the NavBar also is where the user is able to handle login features, being taken to the login or signup page when clicking the respective buttons. As reviews and rare sightings may be accessed from multiple sources, on their individual pages OTA has links that will take the user to either the profile of the contributor that submitted the item, or to the habitat in which the item is about/was found.
